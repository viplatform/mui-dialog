## Commit Lint pre-commit hook rules reference link

1. The commit message will be always in this format type(scope): subject (BLANK LINE) body (BLANK LINE) footer

   - build: changes affecting build systems or external dependencies
   - ci: updating configuration files for continuous integration and deployment services
   - chore: updating grunt tasks etc.; no production code change
   - docs: documentation-only changes
   - feat: a new feature
   - fix: a bug fix
   - perf: a code change that improves performance
   - refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
   - style: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
   - test: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
3. A scope is an optional value that provides additional contextual information about the change. For example, when the moduleâ€™s name, npm package, or particular routine was affected. The scope, when present, must be contained within parenthesis.
4. The subject is the headline of the commit. It should summarize in one sentence the nature of change.
